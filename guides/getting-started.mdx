## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
- **Claude Code** CLI installed and working
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install claude-mem">
    Install the global package using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g claude-mem
    ```

    <Note>
      **Using Bun?** The package also works with Bun, but npm is recommended for global installations to ensure proper CLI registration.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Integration">
    Install the Claude Code hooks with a single command:

    ```bash
    claude-mem install
    ```

    This command:
    - Sets up session hooks in your Claude Code configuration
    - Creates the memory directory structure at `~/.claude-mem/`
    - Configures the Chroma vector database for semantic search
    - Tests the integration to ensure everything works

    <Warning>
      You'll see confirmation messages for each step. If any step fails, the installer will provide specific troubleshooting guidance.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Claude Code">
    For the memory system to activate, restart Claude Code completely:

    ```bash
    # Close all Claude Code sessions and restart
    # On macOS, you can also quit and reopen the application
    ```

    The next time you start Claude Code, you'll see a brief memory loading message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Check that everything is working correctly:

    ```bash
    claude-mem status
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    ‚úÖ Claude Memory System Status

    üì¶ Installation: Installed (User Level)
    üîó Integration: Active
    üß† Memory Index: Ready (0 memories)
    üóëÔ∏è  Smart Trash: Empty
    üìÅ Storage: ~/.claude-mem/
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Memory Session

Now let's create your first persistent memory:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a Claude Code Session">
    Open Claude Code in any project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    claude-code
    ```

    You'll see a brief memory loading message at startup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Have a Meaningful Conversation">
    Discuss your project with Claude. For example:

    - Explain your project structure and goals
    - Discuss coding patterns you prefer
    - Work through a specific problem or feature
    - Review code architecture decisions

    The more context you provide, the better Claude can remember for future sessions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="End the Session">
    When you're done, simply exit Claude Code normally. The session will be automatically compressed into memory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Your Memory">
    View what was remembered:

    ```bash
    claude-mem load-context
    ```

    You'll see a summary of the compressed insights from your session.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a New Session">
    Open Claude Code again in the same or different project:

    ```bash
    claude-code
    ```

    Notice how Claude now has context about your previous conversation and can reference earlier discussions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Memory Behavior

### What Gets Remembered

claude-mem intelligently compresses and stores:

- **Project insights**: Architecture decisions, technical requirements, and goals
- **Problem-solving patterns**: How you approach and solve specific types of issues
- **Code preferences**: Your coding style, preferred libraries, and patterns
- **Decision rationale**: Why certain choices were made
- **Key learnings**: Important discoveries and insights from your sessions

### What Doesn't Get Remembered

To protect privacy and maintain relevance:

- **Sensitive information**: API keys, passwords, or personal data
- **Verbose debugging output**: Long error logs or repetitive troubleshooting
- **Off-topic conversations**: Discussions unrelated to your development work
- **Transient state**: Temporary variables, current session specifics

### Memory Loading

<Tip>
  **Smart Context Loading**: claude-mem loads relevant memories based on your current project. It uses the directory name to filter and prioritize the most relevant context.
</Tip>

    A[Start Claude Code] --> B[Load Project Context]
    B --> C[Filter by Project Name]
    C --> D[Rank by Relevance]

```

## Essential Commands

Here are the commands you'll use most frequently:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="claude-mem status - Check System Health">
    ```bash
    claude-mem status
    ```

    Shows installation status, memory count, and system health. Use this to troubleshoot issues or verify everything is working.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="claude-mem load-context - Preview Memories">
    ```bash
    # View recent memories for current project
    claude-mem load-context

    # View memories for a specific project
    claude-mem load-context --project my-project

    # Get raw JSON output
    claude-mem load-context --format json
    ```

    Perfect for understanding what Claude will remember about your project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="claude-mem logs - Troubleshoot Issues">
    ```bash
    # View recent logs
    claude-mem logs

    # Follow logs in real-time
    claude-mem logs --follow

    # View only errors
    claude-mem logs --error
    ```

    Essential for debugging when memories aren't loading correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="claude-mem save - Manual Memory Creation">
    ```bash
    claude-mem save "Important insight about authentication patterns"
    ```

    Manually save important insights that you want Claude to remember.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## File System Overview

claude-mem creates a clean directory structure:

```
~/.claude-mem/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index/           # Compressed memory index (JSONL format)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archives/        # Raw conversation transcripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/           # Claude Code integration scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trash/           # Safe deletion recovery (Smart Trash‚Ñ¢)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/           # Operation logs for troubleshooting
```

<Warning>
  **Don't manually edit these files**. Always use the claude-mem CLI commands to interact with your memories. Direct file modification can corrupt the memory index.
</Warning>

## Quick Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work as expected:

1. **Check Status**: Run `claude-mem status` to identify issues
2. **Reinstall Hooks**: Try `claude-mem install --force`
3. **Restart Claude Code**: Completely restart the application
4. **Check Logs**: Use `claude-mem logs --error` to see error details

<Tip>
  Most issues are resolved by running `claude-mem install --force` and restarting Claude Code. This refreshes all integration components.
