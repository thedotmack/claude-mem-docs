Everything below works after installation. Most workflows are automatic. Optional features are clearly marked.

## Instant Context Loading

**What happens:** Start Claude Code. Recent memories load instantly.

```
🧠 Claude Memory System
────────────────────────────────
📚 Found 8 relevant memories:

• Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
• Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
• Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
• State: Zustand for global state
• Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
• Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
• API: RESTful with rate limiting
• Preferences: Tabs (4 spaces), strict mode
────────────────────────────────
```

**How it works:** The session-start hook pulls the latest saved memories for the current project from the local index. Ask Claude to run a semantic search via the claude-mem MCP tools when you need something older or more specific.

## Instant Memory Compression

**What happens:** Type `/compact` and the conversation is saved immediately. During installation you can opt-in to also save when `/clear` runs.

**Before:**
```
You: How should we handle auth?
Claude: Let's use JWT tokens with...
[100 messages later]
You: /compact
```

**After:**
```
✨ Compressed to memory:
"Project uses JWT authentication with refresh tokens,
15-minute access token expiry, httpOnly cookies for
security, and Redis for token blacklisting."
```

**Zero effort.** `/compact` works out of the box, and `/clear` compression is available if you enabled it during install.

## Instant Recovery (Smart Trash)

**What happens:** Delete something by accident? It's still there.

```bash
# Oops, deleted important memories
$ claude-mem restore

🗑️ Smart Trash Recovery
────────────────────────────────
Found 3 deleted items:

❯ auth-implementation (2 hours ago)
  database-schema (3 hours ago)
  api-endpoints (yesterday)

Select file to restore:
✅ Restored auth-implementation.1726096800
```

**Never lose data.** Smart Trash keeps everything recoverable. Restore one item at a time to track changes.

## Semantic Search

**What happens:** Ask Claude to run `mcp__claude-mem__chroma_query_documents` and it searches your memories by meaning.

Typical natural-language prompts find:
- Authentication flow details
- JWT implementation fixes
- Password hashing notes
- Session management trade-offs
- Security policies and checklists

**No exact matches needed.** Call the tool anytime for semantic search.

## Session Continuity

**What happens:** Every session builds on the last.

**Session 1:**
```
You: Let's use PostgreSQL with Prisma
Claude: Great choice! I'll set up...
```

**Session 2 (next day):**
```
Claude: I see we're using PostgreSQL with Prisma.
        Let me continue with the schema...
```

**No repetition.** Claude remembers your decisions.

## Status Check

**What happens:** One command shows everything.

```bash
$ claude-mem status

**Complete visibility.** Know exactly what's happening.

## Hook Integration

**What happens:** Claude Code hooks capture everything automatically.

- **session-start:** Loads the latest project memories from the index
- **pre-compact:** Compresses when you type `/compact`
- **session-end:** Optionally saves just before `/clear` (if you enabled save-on-clear)

**No manual triggers.** Once installed, the hooks run without any extra commands.

## Performance

**What happens:** Everything is optimized for speed.

- **Minified runtime:** Smallest possible footprint
- **Lazy loading:** Only loads what's needed
- **Local storage:** No network latency
- **Incremental updates:** Only processes changes

**Zero lag.** Designed to be invisible.

## Privacy

**What happens:** Your data stays yours.

- **Local only:** Everything stored on your machine
- **No telemetry:** Zero data collection
- **Open source:** Audit the code yourself
- **Your control:** Delete anything, anytime

**Complete privacy.** No cloud. No tracking. Just local memory.

## Project Detection

**What happens:** Knows which project you're in.

Open `/Users/you/my-app` and claude-mem:
1. Detects the project name
2. Loads project-specific memories
3. Ignores unrelated context
4. Maintains project isolation

**Smart context.** Each project gets its own memory space.

## CLAUDE.md Integration

**What happens:** Adds memory instructions to your CLAUDE.md automatically.

```markdown
<!-- CLAUDE-MEM QUICK REFERENCE -->
## 🧠 Memory System Quick Reference

### Search Your Memories (SIMPLE & POWERFUL)
- **Semantic search is king**: `mcp__claude-mem__chroma_query_documents(["search terms"])`
- **🔒 ALWAYS include project name in query**: `["claude-mem feature authentication"]` not just `["feature authentication"]`
- **Include dates for temporal search**: `["project-name 2025-09-09 bug fix"]` finds memories from that date
- **Get specific memory**: `mcp__claude-mem__chroma_get_documents(ids: ["document_id"])`

### Storage
- Collection: "claude_memories"
- Archives: ~/.claude-mem/archives/
<!-- /CLAUDE-MEM QUICK REFERENCE -->
```

**Claude knows to search.** No manual reminders needed.

## Updates

**What happens:** Stay current automatically.

```bash
$ npm update -g claude-mem
$ claude-mem install --force
```

**Always improving.** Updates preserve your memories.

## The Magic Is No Magic

Everything above happens with **zero configuration** and **zero commands** (except the initial install).

This is what "it just works" actually means.
