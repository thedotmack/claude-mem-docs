## That's literally it.

No configuration. No setup. No learning curve. It just works.

When you start Claude Code, you'll see:

```
ðŸ§  Claude Memory System - Active
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
ðŸ“š Loading relevant memories...
âœ¨ Context ready. Start coding.
```

## What Just Happened?

- âœ… Hooks installed (captures your sessions)
- âœ… MCP server configured (manages memories)
- âœ… Smart Trashâ„¢ enabled (never lose anything)
- âœ… Semantic search tools ready (ask Claude to run them when you need deep recall)
- âœ… `/compact` compression active (optional `/clear` saving if you enabled it)

All automatic. All instant.

## Try It Now

1. Ask Claude something: "Remember I prefer TypeScript strict mode"
2. Type `/compact`
3. Start a new session
4. Watch your preference appear automatically

## Need Help?

```bash
