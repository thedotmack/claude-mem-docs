# Claude Memory System (claude-mem)

## Remember that one thing? Neither do we… but `claude-mem` does! 😵‍💫

Stop repeating yourself. `claude-mem` remembers what you and Claude Code figure out, so every new chat starts smarter than the last.

## Why claude-mem?

Every time you start a new Claude Code session, you're starting from scratch. You have to re-explain your project structure, remind Claude about that bug you fixed yesterday, and repeat the same context over and over.

**claude-mem changes that.**

### 🧠 What it does

- **Remembers key insights** from your coding sessions
- **Compresses conversations** into searchable memories
- **Loads relevant context** automatically when you start
- **Works silently** in the background via hooks

## How it works

1. **Install once** - `npm install -g claude-mem && claude-mem install`
2. **Code normally** - claude-mem watches your Claude Code sessions
3. **Automatic compression** - When you finish, memories are saved
4. **Smart loading** - Next session starts with relevant context

No configuration needed. No manual commands. It just works.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g claude-mem

# Set up the integration
claude-mem install

# That's it! Restart Claude Code and you're ready
```

When you start your next session, you'll see:

```
📚 Memories

🔍 Found 3 relevant memories from previous sessions

1. Fixed authentication bug in login component
2. Implemented dark mode with Tailwind CSS
3. Optimized database queries for user dashboard
