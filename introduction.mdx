## Claude Memory System

## One command. Then Claude just remembers. That's it.

```bash
npm install -g claude-mem && claude-mem install
```

**Done.** Claude now remembers every insight, fix, and decision from your previous sessions. No configuration. No manual commands. It just works.

ðŸ“š Found 5 relevant memories:

â€¢ Fixed authentication bug with JWT tokens
â€¢ Database schema uses PostgreSQL with Prisma
â€¢ Dark mode implementation uses Tailwind CSS
â€¢ API rate limiting set to 100 requests/minute
â€¢ Prefer tabs over spaces (4 spaces width)
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

## The Problem It Solves

Without claude-mem:
- ðŸ˜¤ "Remember that bug we fixed yesterday?"
- ðŸ˜¤ "What was that API endpoint again?"
- ðŸ˜¤ "Did we decide on tabs or spaces?"
- ðŸ˜¤ Starting fresh every. single. time.

With claude-mem:
- âœ¨ Claude knows your bug fixes
- âœ¨ Claude knows your API structure
- âœ¨ Claude knows your preferences
- âœ¨ Every session builds on the last
