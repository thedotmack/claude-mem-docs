## Synopsis

```bash
claude-mem restore
```

## Description

Recover deleted items interactively:

1. **Interactive Selection** - Choose from available trash items
2. **Safe Recovery** - Restores to current working directory
3. **Simple Process** - No complex options or flags needed

<Note>
No options or flags - simple and safe through interactive selection.
</Note>

## Examples

### Basic Restoration

```bash
claude-mem restore
```

**Interactive Flow:**
```
? Select file to restore: (Use arrow keys)
❯ config.json.1726405815234
  old-memories.jsonl.1726319122456
  project-backup.1726405815234
  session-transcript.log.1726302008789
```

**After Selection:**
```
Restored config.json.1726405815234
```

Restores to current directory with original name (`config.json`).

### Empty Trash

When trash is empty:

```bash
claude-mem restore
```

**Output:**
```
Trash is empty
```

No selection interface appears.

### Canceling Restoration

During selection:

1. **Press Esc** or **Ctrl+C** to cancel
2. No items are restored
3. Returns to command prompt immediately

```
? Select file to restore: (Use arrow keys)
❯ config.json.1726405815234
  old-memories.jsonl.1726319122456
^C
```

No output on cancellation.

## How Restoration Works

### File Naming

Items return to original names:

- **Trash:** `config.json.1726405815234`
- **Restored:** `config.json`

Timestamp suffix automatically removed.

### Target Location

Restore to **current working directory**:

```bash
# Working in /home/user/projects/my-app
cd /home/user/projects/my-app
claude-mem restore

# File restored to: /home/user/projects/my-app/config.json
```

<Warning>
Ensure you're in the correct directory before running `claude-mem restore`.
</Warning>

### Conflict Handling

When file exists:

- **Overwrites existing file** without warning
- No backup of existing file is created
- Be careful when restoring to avoid data loss

```bash
# If config.json already exists in current directory
claude-mem restore
# Selecting config.json.1726405815234 will overwrite existing config.json
```

## Directory Restoration

### Folder Recovery

Restore directories with full contents:

```bash
# Trash contains: project-backup.1726405815234/
claude-mem restore

# Restores to: ./project-backup/
# With all subdirectories and files intact
```

### Directory Structure

Preserves directory structure:

```
# Original structure before deletion:
project-backup/
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utils.js
├── docs/
│   └── readme.md
└── package.json

# After restoration:
./project-backup/
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utils.js
├── docs/
│   └── readme.md
└── package.json
```

## Selection Interface

### Navigation

Keyboard controls:

| Key | Action |
|-----|---------|
| **↑/↓** | Navigate up/down |
| **Enter** | Select current item |
| **Esc** | Cancel restoration |
| **Ctrl+C** | Cancel restoration |

### Display Format

Shows trash names with timestamps:

```
? Select file to restore:
❯ config.json.1726405815234          ← Most recent
  old-memories.jsonl.1726319122456   ← Older
  session-transcript.log.1726302008789 ← Oldest
```

Ordered by deletion time (newest first).

## Use Cases

### Accidental Deletion Recovery

Recover accidentally deleted files:

```bash
# Oops, deleted important config
rm config.json

# Check what's in trash
claude-mem trash-view

# Restore the file
claude-mem restore
# → Select config.json.1726405815234
# → File restored as config.json
```

### Project Restoration

Recover project folders:

```bash
# Restore full project directory
claude-mem restore
# → Select project-backup.1726405815234
# → Full directory restored as project-backup/
```

### Memory Recovery

Restore memory files:

```bash
# Restore accidentally deleted memory index
claude-mem restore
# → Select memories.jsonl.1726405815234
# → Memory file restored
```

## Best Practices

### Preparation

Before restoring:

1. **Navigate to correct directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/intended/location
   ```

2. **Check existing files**
   ```bash
   ls -la  # Verify what's already present
   ```

3. **View trash contents**
   ```bash
   claude-mem trash-view  # See what's available
   ```

### Safety

Avoid conflicts:

1. **Backup existing files** before restoration
   ```bash
   cp important-file.txt important-file.txt.backup
   ```

2. **Use temporary directory** for inspection
   ```bash
   mkdir temp-restore
   cd temp-restore
   claude-mem restore
   # Inspect restored files, then move to final location
   ```

3. **Check file timestamps** to identify correct version
   ```bash
   claude-mem trash-view  # Note deletion dates
   ```

## Error Handling

### Permission Denied

Permission errors:

```bash
claude-mem restore
# → Permission denied writing to current directory
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -ld .

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 .

# Or move to writable directory
cd ~/Documents
claude-mem restore
```

### Disk Space

Insufficient space:

```bash
claude-mem restore
# → No space left on device
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check available space
df -h .

# Free up space or choose different directory
cd /path/with/more/space
claude-mem restore
```

### Corrupted Trash Items

Corrupted items:

```bash
claude-mem restore
# → Error reading trash item
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check trash integrity
claude-mem trash-view

# If necessary, clean corrupted items
claude-mem trash empty
```

## Integration

### With Workflow Scripts

Automate in scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Restore to specific directory
cd /home/user/recovery/
echo "Restoring to recovery directory..."

# Note: restore command is interactive,
# so automation requires expect or similar tools
```

### With File Management

Workflow patterns:

```bash
# 1. Check what's available
claude-mem trash-view

# 2. Navigate to target location
cd /path/to/restore/location

# 3. Restore items
claude-mem restore

# 4. Verify restoration
ls -la
```

## Limitations

### Interactive Only

- No batch restoration options
- No command-line file specification
- No scripting-friendly modes

### Single Directory Target

- Always restores to current working directory
- No option to specify different target location
- No support for restoring to original location

### No Conflict Resolution

- Overwrites existing files without prompting
- No backup of overwritten files
- No merge options for directories

## Troubleshooting

### No Items to Restore

```bash
claude-mem restore
# → Trash is empty
```

**Possible causes:**
1. No files have been deleted
2. Trash was previously emptied
3. Items were manually removed from trash directory

### Selection Interface Issues

Interface issues:

1. **Terminal compatibility** - Ensure terminal supports interactive prompts
2. **SSH sessions** - May not support interactive mode
3. **Screen/tmux** - May interfere with prompt display

### Restoration to Wrong Location

Wrong location:

1. **Check current directory**
   ```bash
   pwd  # Verify where you ran restore command
   ```

2. **Find restored files**
   ```bash
   find . -name "restored-filename" -type f
   ```

3. **Move to correct location**
   ```bash
   mv restored-file /correct/path/
   ```
